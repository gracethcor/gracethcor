🌟 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an IT Systems International Student in Canada with a passion for coding and problem-solving. 

👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge in technology and exploring new coding challenges, and contributing to meaningful projects.

🎮 As a #girlgamer, you'll often find me immersed in the world of MMORPG (nothing beats the classic pRO/Philippine Ragnarok Online). I've ventured into private servers like DarkRO and I'm still an avid player, always up for an epic adventure.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects that involve coding, scripting, and exploring the world of IT.
